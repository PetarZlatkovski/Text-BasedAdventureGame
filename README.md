Text-Based Adventure Game


DESCRIPTION	
The application I’ve made is a Text-Based Adventure game, where the events are described through text in the console. The game is called The Last King and it contains an ASCII art title screen in the beginning. In the game you can: name your character, make their attack or defense stronger, fight monsters (some with joke names), buy potions that heal you in battle, rest to regain lost health etc. The game also features a simple story where the player, must save their brother.

CHALLENGES
	I faced many challenges with this project such as syntax errors that I made, but also figuring out the battle system and making it relatively balanced as well as playtesting the game many times to ensure there are no errors.

INSTALLATION
	The game has no installation and we have to simply run it in the IDE or console


HOW TO USE
	To play the game the player must simply input 1, 2 or 3 depending on what they would like to do.

CREDITS
	For the code I asked for advice from a sophomore student, Kiril Lazarov, who gave me advice on how to optimize the code, and which methods and classes I should make. He didn’t write any code for me, he only told me what type of methods I should make and use.
